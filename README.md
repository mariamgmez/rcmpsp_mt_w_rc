# We selected and modified 36 instances of the MPSPLib (http://www.mpsplib.com). This library is composed of 140 generated instances from the combination of 2, 5, 10, or 20 problems (projects) of the PSPLib (http://www.om-db.wi.tum.de/psplib/main.html). In MPSPLib, the global resource availabilities for each time period are defined. In addition, each project represented by an instance of PSPLib considers the availability of each type of resource. Given this, to configure the set of instances with mixed resources, we modified the existence of global resources by modifying the ones defined in the MPSPLib instances and the local resources defined for each used sub-instance of the PSPLib. Moreover, to preserve the stability of resource availability, the global resources are uniformly distributed among each project, and the global availability of each type of resource was.

In addition, the resource costs are added to the instances defined in the MPSPLib. These costs are defined following the practical research presented in (https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5021839), where, based on the collected data and experts' experience, the costs of renewable resources are defined as random integers between 1 and 8.

The instances selection was carried out uniformly concerning the number of projects (_a), jobs (_j), and different among projects (_nr).
